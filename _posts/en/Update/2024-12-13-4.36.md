<div class="gpcl tip">Changes</div>

**Shortcut Configuration**
* The function has been completely redesigned. You can now customize each shortcut..
* Simply press the shortcut key (HK) to configure.<br>
* It is now possible via a keyboard shortcut to change the city groups (previous/next). - Idea by @LeeMing | Dave and improved by @Neriss<br>

**Population Usage Percentage**
* After the grepolis update some data was deleted, which produced an error in the percentage "NaN%"
* Also, the previous function did not take into account Pygmalion, Aphrodite's spell that provides 5 pop for each farm level. - Thanks to @Neriss

**Compatibility with GrepoTools**
* Fixed: small icons on the map were not visible.

**DIO-TOOLS Setting**
* Fixed: Settings were not showing at some times.

**Activating DIO-TOOLS multiple times**
* An error occurs if the script is executed a 2nd time. (ex: Simultaneous use of Tampermonkey & Violentmonkey)<br>

**Troop speed**
* Fixed: Pop-up window not working.

**MapIcons** - Thanks to @Neriss
* Updated MapIcons for a smoother experience and renamed them to avoid conflicts with the JS map.

**Troop Speed** - Thanks to @Neriss
* Fixed the display of "Troop Speed" in the attack/support window, which was missing in some cases.

**Activity Box** - Thanks to @Neriss
* Fixed the command bar not updating instantly after movement changes.

**Barracks** - Thanks to @Neriss
* Fixed the reload button mistakenly added to the wrong window.

**Attack/Support** - Thanks to @Neriss
* CFixed attack/support elements moving when selecting “Select All” if the language-specific text was too long.

**Daily Rewards** - Thanks to @Neriss
* Improved performance: the reward minimizer is now called only once, and timers have been adjusted.

**Smileys/Defense Form** - Thanks to @Neriss
* Fixed: smileys and the form now appear instantly when the note text box is displayed.

**Recruitment Trade** - Thanks to @Neriss
* Fixed: no green bar was displayed at 0%.
