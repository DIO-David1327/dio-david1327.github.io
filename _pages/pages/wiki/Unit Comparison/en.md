**What is Unit Comparison?**  
The unit comparison is presented in the form of tables.  
In these tables, you will find various comparisons (cost, speed, loot, etc.) -> all compared per 1 population.

**Accessing the Unit Comparison**  
You can access the unit comparison simply by clicking on the small icon located below the "Go to current city" button. This is the button with an image of a small green helmet.
